## CI/CD Pipeline for Flutter

This document describes the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for a Flutter project.
Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is divided into three main stages:

1. Development

In the development phase, code is committed to the repository. Before the commit is finalized, pre-commit hooks enforce code quality and consistency.
Pre-Commit Hooks

The following steps are performed before pushing the code:

- Commit Message Enforcement: Ensures meaningful commit messages.
- Code Formatting (dart format .): Ensures consistent code formatting.
- Automatic Fixes (dart fix): Applies Dart fixes to resolve potential issues.
- Static Analysis (flutter analyze): Detects errors and warnings in the code.
- Git Commit and Push: If all checks pass, the changes are pushed to the repository.

2. Server

Once the code reaches the repository, the CI/CD pipeline triggers the following steps:

- Check for Changes: Verifies if new commits have been pushed.
- Set Environment: Loads necessary environment variables.
- Build: Compiles the Flutter project.
- Deploy: Publishes the build to the desired environment (e.g., staging or production).
- Flutter Tests: Runs unit and integration tests.

3. Production

The final stage involves hosting the built Flutter web application for users.

- Web Deployment: The compiled Flutter web app is hosted and made accessible online.

### Improvements

To enhance this pipeline, consider the following improvements:

- Automate Testing and Code Coverage
    - Integrate unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests in the pre-commit stage to catch errors early. Use a tool like Codecov or SonarQube to track code coverage.

    - Continuous Deployment Strategy
        - Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts.Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Bitrise for automation.

    - Better Error Handling
        - Integrate Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics to track errors post-deployment.

    - Performance Monitoring
        - Use Firebase Performance Monitoring to track app performance in production.

    - Automated Security Checks
        - Use OWASP Dependency-Check to identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

    - Parallel Execution for Faster Builds
        - Run tests and builds in parallel to speed up CI/CD pipelines.
